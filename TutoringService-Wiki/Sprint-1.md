# Sprint planning
* based on user stories, build a domain model that dress the functionality of the application, using UML Lab to generate the code and do the data mapping, creating a persistence layer and persistence layer testing for the initial deliverable 

# User story estimation and backlog
* use case: 3 story points
* detailed specifications(assigned to each member): 1 story point
* system requirements: 3 story points
* domain model: 8 story points
* generate code from the domain model: 1 story point
* data mapping model: 3 story points
* data mapping with UML Lab: 2 story points
* persistence layer testing: 5 story points
* continuous integration - Travis CI: 2 story points
* build system: 2 story points
* documentations: 8 story points

# Sprint retrospective 
* Leave everything before the deadline is a bad idea
* Coding, especially for a large project requires more time than you expected
* Inefficient meeting is a drawback for the project development
* Setup deadline before the actual deliverable is helpful
* Late submission is good unless you managed to get everything required done by the next 24 hours
* Understanding the technologies and tools at a high level is helpful
* Learning by doing is the best way for coding
