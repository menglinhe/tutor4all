## Sprint retrospective
* Waiting for review for each merge request ensures master is kept clean
* Clear division of tasks by features increases accountability and productivity
* Essential to run Travis CI commands locally before pushing so we are unaffected by lengthy build times if we must merge immediately
* Leaving merges late leads to lengthy build times coinciding with other teams - start earlier
* Important to have block comments for methods to explain contents, parameters, return value with consistency
* Important to discuss logical code changes in group to know what the original decision decision was based off instead of acting unilaterally
* Commented out code only increases clutter, should be stored away on a different branch and introduced when required, not introduced to master
* New division of roles leads to better work split in terms of equal workload 
* Better cohesive communication through Git issues and Slack, despite no in person meetings
