Some key decisions
- Due to the time manner, the team members are grouped into 2 with two sprints
- Charles and Omar focus on Android App implementation
- Anas takes care of the web-frontend implementation of requirements with backend integration with added fixes to Deliverable 3 and will do the live demo during the presentation
- Menglin is responsible for the UI design and update for both Android and Web app, make sure the Dark mode is working with web app
- Menglin and Huzaifa will do the presentation, they will make the presentation slides and practice 
- Modification can be made when it's necessary
- Like the previous deliverable, no one in the team should work directly with master
